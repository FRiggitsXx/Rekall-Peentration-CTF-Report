# Rekall-Peentration-CTF-Report
--The inital test was conducted via Kali-Linux, inside Azure-Labs.--
My second penetration test report. CTF
A fraction of the initial test was a group activity, with or without completing all flags, it was my responsibility to gather all the correlating screenshots and proper notes to compose a formal report.
